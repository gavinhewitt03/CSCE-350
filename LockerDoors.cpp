    There a n lockers in a hallway, numbered sequentially from 1 to n. Initially, all the
  locker doors are closed. You make r passes by the lockers, each time starting
  with locker #1.
    On the ith pass, i = 1, 2, â€¦., r, you toggle the door of every ith locker: if the door
  is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it. After the last pass, display the
  following output:
    (a) Locker door# and their status (open/ closed)
    (b) How many locker doors are open?
